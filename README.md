# Checkrr
Scan your library files for corrupt media and replace the files via sonarr and radarr

[![](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/server/dkTfNKbEhJ)](https://discord.gg/dkTfNKbEhJ)

## Why does this exist
I've been running a media library for the past ~ 8 years migrating my library between both servers (I've had 3 so far) and filesystems (ext4 on LVM was a mistake). I've lost whole disks worth of data in the past and my library has had various problems ever since that I have never bothered to fully track down until now. 

Checkrr runs various checks (ffprobe, magic number, mimetype, and file hash on subsequent runs to drastically improve speed) on the path you specify as `checkpath` in the config. 

* If the file passes inspection, the hash is recorded in a bbolt flatfile DB so future runs are insanely fast on large libraries. 
* If the file fails all checks checkrr will check sonarr and/or radarr for the file removing it and requesting a new version via the correct system (assuming they are enabled... you could just run checkrr in a no-op state by setting `sonarr.process: false` and `radarr.process: false` in the config and then egrep the output like so `checkrr check | egrep "Hash Mismatch|not a recongized file type"` for environments that do not run either of these.)

## Installation
cli on existing system:
Grab a release from the releases page.

docker:
`docker pull ghcr.io/aetaric/checkrr:latest`

## Usage

### cli on existing system
cli as a daemon:
``` checkrr -c /etc/checkrr.yaml ```

cli as a one-off:
``` checkrr -c /etc/checkrr.yaml -o```

### docker:
``` docker run -v /path/to/checkrr.yaml:/etc/checkrr.yaml -v /path/to/media:/media -v /path/to/checkrr.db:/checkrr.db aetaric/checkrr:latest ```

### docker-compose:
create the following docker-compose.yaml file in the usual fashion

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  checkrr:
    container_name: checkrr
    image: aetaric/checkrr:latest
    volumes:
      - /path/to/checkrr/config/checkrr.yaml:/etc/checkrr.yaml
      - /path/to/checkrr/config/checkrr.db:/checkrr.db
      - /path/to/movies/to/scan:/movies
      - /path/to/tv/to/scan:/tv
    ports:
      - 8585:8585
    restart: on-failure
```

Run the following command to initialise the databases
```touch /path/to/checkrr/config/checkrr.db ```

Paste in and modify the default configuration file from https://github.com/aetaric/checkrr/blob/main/checkrr.yaml.example

``` vi /path/to/checkrr/config/checkrr.yaml ```


Bring up checkrr once to check it's running


``` cd /path/to/checkrr/docker-compose.yaml ```
```docker-compose up ```

Navigate to http://IP.ADDRESS.OF.DOCKER.HOST:8585

Bring up checkrr as a daemon to leave running
``` cd /path/to/checkrr/docker-compose.yaml```
```docker-compose up -d ```
 
Wait a day for checkrr to run on schedule.

## Upgrading to 2.x
Checkrr 2.x has a more organized config file and quite a reduction in CLI flags. Checkout `checkrr --help` for the flag changes. You will have to manually conform your config file to the example file in the repo; checkrr no longer outputs a default config.

## Unknown file deletion
If you are feeling especially spicy, there is `RemoveUnknownFiles` flag in the config. This flag is destructive. It will remove any file that isn't detected as a valid Video, Audio, Document, or plain text file. 

**Seriously** I don't recommend you run this on the first pass if at all. You are very likely to lose something you didn't expect to lose. 

Before using this flag, run checkrr and read the full output to ensure you don't nuke a file that you don't want to lose. Run it again with sonarr and/or radarr enabled.

*I am not responsible for your use of this flag. I will not help you sort out any damage you cause to your library. Issues opened around this flag's usage will be summarily closed as PEBCAK.*

## Building
Should you want to build checkrr, you can do so with the following:
`cd webserver && yarn build && cd .. && go build`
Please note, if you build checkrr yourself, you will be told to download the official release if you open an issue for a bug.

## Contributions
Something something fork and PR if you have something to add to checkrr. I'm happy to review PRs as they come in.

## FAQ

### How do I add multiple paths for checkrr to check?
You can specify multiple folders to check via the config file
```yaml
checkrr:
  checkpath:
    - /media/TV_Shows
    - /media/Movies
```
